	<description>Adds male body type for Moyo.

Now this one is a long time in the making, and by that I mean I finished it a long time ago but I don't like making preview images so I put it off until now. But hey, it is finally here! Now I can stop feeling bad for not releasing it and I can move on to other projects. If you want to play with Male Red Moyo, you're in luck, because that mod will be released side-by-side with this mod!

I added a male body type to the Moyo, so now you can more effectively tell the female Moyo from the male Moyo. Since I felt like there was enough hairstyles, I didn't add any in this mod.

I have added appropriate male versions to all of the apparel, including male versions of apparel from Moyo-The cartel arrives and Dragonian mods. Honestly, I've debated on whether I want to create a custom namer for Moyo. I might in the future, but I haven't created one yet.

If there are any other alien races you want me to add males to, let me know and I might devote some time to creating those assets and patches as well.</description>
